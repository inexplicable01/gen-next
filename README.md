gen-next mobile app


This app is being developed by a fertility clinic to help the doctors and their patients to share information and be on the same page.    A big part of being on the same page is to have a calendar to note down their menstrual cyclees, sexual activity and when to take medication.

Currently the App has two pages.

Calendar page:  The calendar component will be a infinitely scrollable calendar with no gaps between Months.
Users will be able to click on a date and notes about that day will pop up at the bottom.  If the user wants to edit the notes, they can simple click on the notes and a modal will pop up showing the different options available.
In the calendar component underneath the date number, certain letters or symbol will pop up if certain notes are written.

Projection page:  The user can use this page to project from a certain date.  Assuming a certain procedure is performed on X date, how will the women expect to deliver?  When will she need to come in for a checkup etc.
Once the user selects an option in the dropdown menu, a table of projections appear.


Additional Desired feature:
  - a Inspirational message.    This is not necessaryily a page.  We just want to be able to present a quote of the day kinda of message for the patients.  Maybe it could be a modal, maybe it could be a page by itself.  Up to Designer.
  - A welcome page with disclaimer.
